# Budget App

A minimal starting point for a personal budgeting application. This repository is currently language-agnostic; you can add your preferred stack (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go) and evolve the structure.

## Goals
- Track income and expenses
- Categorize transactions
- Provide summaries and basic analytics
- Support import/export (e.g., CSV)

## Project Structure
- src/ — place application source code here
- docs/ — design notes, specs, decisions, and documentation

## Getting Started
1. Decide your tech stack.
2. Initialize language-specific tooling (e.g., package manager, virtualenv).
3. Start implementing core modules in src/.

## Roadmap
- Define data model (accounts, categories, transactions)
- Input pipeline (manual entry, CSV importer)
- Reporting (monthly summaries, category breakdowns)
- Persistence layer (file/db)

## License
Add a LICENSE file of your choice (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.).
